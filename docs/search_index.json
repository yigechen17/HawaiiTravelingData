As the tourism of Hawaii is well developed, we believe there should be enough data collected that can help us to explore the development of the tourism of Hawaii. Here we come up with three questions: What kind of people like going to Hawaii for vacation, is Hawaii a good travel destination for students like us? Can we make a perfect travel plan based on the activities of other tourists? Is the tourism of Hawaii influenced by the pandemic? If it is, how bad? To help solve the problems, we searched Hawaii Tourism public data on Google and found a tourism data warehouse that enables us to customize and download data sets about Hawaii’s tourism industry in difference perspectives. We believe the open data website contains enough information for us to answer our questions, for example: For question 1, we can explore the features of tourists by downloading data sets containing their basic information like age, gender, departure place, travel purposes, their daily expenditure in Hawaii, etc.. If it is the majority of visitors are younger people who come from all over the world (meaning a safe place), the money their average expenditure is not high for us, then maybe we could consider Hawaii as a affordable destination. For question 2, we can make the travel plan based on what islands do most people go, what activities do they do on each island and the average time they spend there. All these data could be found on the official data website. For question 3, we may explore this question by studying if the answers of the two previous questions (or the pattern of the two data sets) have changed in the past two years. Since we have all the data from 1990 to 2021, we may not be limited to the pandemic period, but to do the data analyse for the whole time period. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Together, we searched Hawaii Tourism public data on Google and found a tourism data warehouse that enables us to customize and download data sets about Hawaii’s tourism industry in difference perspectives. By inputting different filters and get different outputs from the warehouse, we found data about visitor arrival, length of stay, their places of departure, destination islands and purposes of travelling from Jan 1990 to Dec 2021. For example, for the data describing the number of visitors from different states to different islands, we can do: We downloaded 5 datasets in total. Dataset1 mainly includes the number of visitor arrivaled, length of stay, total expenditure within the period they stay in Hawaii, etc. Dataset2 has only one attribute that is different to dataset1, which is the state that visitors come from. Dataset3 also adds an attribute to dataset2 which is number of visitors that go to each island of Hawaii. Dataset4 contains average age of visitors, their purpose to come to Hawaii and their accomodation choices. All of the variables are contineous variables. Data1 has 1200 observations, data2 has 6000 observations, data2.1 has 21000 observations and data4 has 4320 observations. There are two major problems about the data. Firstly, when it comes to the number of visitors choosing different accomodation and going to Hawaii for different purposes, there could be some overlaps between different categories. The way we dealt with this problem was to reallocate the categories and assign some small categories into a new category “others”. The second problem was the missing value problem. We found out that the data from 1999 to 2018 are partially missing in different dimensions, as well as the data in 2020 and 2021 due to time delay. Therefore, we decided to use the data in 2019 when analysing the first two problems, as it could be representative to most of the years (without the impact of the pandemic). Here we demonstrate the first 3 rows of data4 to provide a more intuitive understanding of what our datasets look like: ## Group Indicator Units X1999 X2000 X2001 X2002 X2003 ## 1 Oahu visitors Avg. age of party head number NA NA NA NA NA ## 2 Oahu visitors First timer (%) percent 46 46.4 44 43 43 ## 3 Oahu visitors Repeaters (%) percent 54 53.6 56 57 57 ## X2004 X2005 X2006 X2007 X2008 X2009 X2010 X2011 X2012 X2013 X2014 X2015 X2016 ## 1 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 43.9 43.6 44.2 44.1 ## 2 43.3 43 42.3 41.4 41.2 40.3 40.3 40.9 42.2 41.8 42.4 41.7 41.7 ## 3 56.7 57 57.7 58.6 58.8 59.7 59.7 59.1 57.8 58.2 57.6 58.3 58.3 ## X2017 X2018 X2019 X2020 X2021 ## 1 44.3 44.5 44.4 44.0 NA ## 2 40.9 39.7 38.1 34.8 36.7 ## 3 59.1 60.3 61.9 65.2 63.3 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation “Describe the process of getting the data into a form in which you could work with it in R. If your code does not lend itself to being including in the .Rmd file, provide a link to the folder or file(s) that contain(s) that code.” To tidy our data, firstly we chose to convert all the blank observations into NAs using a helper function “empty_as_na”. Then, we deleted redundant characters in the names of columns, for instance, all the “X”s in front of the years like “X2019”. As there are a lot of missing values through the years, we may especially concern about the data since 2019 when analyzing the first two problems. We kept the data in year 2019 using “filter” command in tidyverse package. Our code is shown below The code of data transformation could be found in the link: https://github.com/Weijiaaaa/5293_r/blob/main/Final%20project%20Ch3%20data%20transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this chapter, we discuss the pattern of missing values in our datasets. After carefully observing our data, we found out that data1, data2, data2.1, data3 do not have a lot of missing data. Even though they do, the missing pattern is pretty neat. Take data3 as an example, all the data from 1990 to 1997 are missing for indicators except from visitor arrivals. Therefore, we applied a heatmap for each of these datasets to show the missing patterns of the four datasets: From the plots we can see that data1 is only missing 8 values in Expenditure and PPPD (Per person per day spending) for 4 years. For data2, only average length of stay and visitor days in year 2021 is missing. For data2.1, the three indicators are all missing in 2021. For data3, all the data from 1990 to 1997 are missing for indicators except from visitor arrivals. The story is pretty different for data4. Intuitively speaking, data4 has a lot of missing data in different indicators and different years. Therefore, we applied 3 different plots to present the pattern of missing values in data4: From the histogram plot and the heatmap we can see that data for all destinations in 1999 to 2017 are greatly missing. And in the heatmap for missing data in different years and indicators shown below, we can see that the for year 2016 to 2020, no data is missing. In conclusion, the only years with no missing value at all should be 2018 and 2019. As the data in 2018 is too old, we chose to use the data in 2019 as our observation when analysing the first 2 problems. In problem 3 where we analyse the impact of pandemic on the tourism in Hawaii, we would use data in year 2018 to 2021. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results From our analysis, we found out that most people come to Hawaii for vacation, and most of them would choose to come again. Additionally, we found people in the north and west US has a higher rate choosing Hawaii travel. As for the Accommodation choice, people tend to rest in hotels and condos. For the destination, Oahu island and Maui island are the most popular ones, while people would spend similar time spending in Oahu, Maui, Kona and Kauai island. Lanai island seems to be the least popular island among all. We have also found that visitors from Illinois, Idaho, Georgia, Florida and some other southern states could have a clustering pattern when it comes to their destinations. Considering the time, we found the huge impact of the financial crisis of 2008 and the pandemic to the visitor number and expenditure in Hawaii. There is a seasonality that July and March is the high season while January and September is the low season for Hawaii tourism. The graphs and comments are shown below. 1. What kind of people would come to Hawaii? We analyse this question by exploring the average age of people who come to Hawaii, the percentage of people who come more than one time, and the Hawaii travel rate of the states. From the horizontal barchart we can see that the average age of people that come to Hawaii is 40 to 50 years old. Among all destinations, people who go to Molokai and Lanai are generally older, and people who go to Oahu and Maui island tend to be younger. Also, from the stacked barchart that shows how many visitors come to Hawaii for the first time and how many people have come several times, we can see that more than 60% of people are repeaters, which means that Hawaii is an attractive destination for people who are middle age, and they would always like to come again. Among all the islands in Hawaii, Maui and Kauai islands have the most repeaters, while Lanai island has the lest repeaters. Apart from the features above, we are also curious about whether people from different states have a preference in going to different islands. We firstly build a map to see how many people from different state are coming to Hawaii. The deeper the color, the more people from the state are coming: ## | | | 0% | | | 1% | |= | 1% | |= | 2% | |== | 2% | |== | 3% | |=== | 4% | |=== | 5% | |==== | 5% | |==== | 6% | |===== | 6% | |=====

By looking at the darkness of the red color, we can find Alaska had the highest Hawaii travel rate in 2019, which is far higher than that of the other states. And there is a rough rule: north and west states tend to have higher Hawaii travel rate. This follows our common sense that people living closer to the destination or living under a colder temperature may have a higher willing to take a holiday in Hawaii. Then, We applied a static parallel coordinates plot for further analysis: From the plot we can see that there is no outlier in this dataset. However there are some obvious clusters shown in the plot. For example, Maine, New York, New Jersey, Utha and Vergina is clearly a cluster.To gain a better vision of the parallal coordinate plot, we applied an interactive parallel coordinates plot for the same data: 2. Why do people come here Secondly, we are curious about the reason why people come to Hawaii: There are 4 major reasons for people to go to Hawaii islands: for vacation, to visit friends or relatives, for honeymoon or get married and for other purposes. From the plot we can see that most people go to Hawaii for vacation. The second major reason is that people go there to visit friends and relatives. Among the 6 islands, Molokai island has the most visitors who go there to visit friends and relatives, while Maui island has the least. The number of people that go to Oahu for honeymoon or get married is the most comparing to other islands. 3. Where do people live during their visit? Accommodation is also pretty important when we plan a trip. Should we rent a cabin, or should we live in a hotel? The accommodations that most people choose could be a safer choice for us. From the stacked barchart we can see that the most popular accommodation is hotel and condos are pretty welcome too. Accommodation choices vary from island to island. For Oahu island, the percentage of people who live in hotel outperforms all the other islands, and for Maui island the number of people living in Condos outperforms other islands. 4. Which island is more popular? Now we would like to decide which island we would like to go if our travel time is limit by plotting the number of visitors and the length of them to stay in different islands. From the two tree maps we can see that most people would visit to Oahu island, then Maui island. Kauai and Kona island are the next popular islands, and Hilo is not as popular as the others. Lanai island is the least popular one. But in terms of length of stay, people who visit Maui iland would stay for the longest time which is approximately 8 days, then Oahu, Kauai and Kona islands have similar length of stay of approximately 6 to 7.5 days. People would stay in Molokai, Hilo and Lanai islands for much less time, which is less than 5 days. From this interactive plot, the clustering pattern is much easier to observe. For example, Now we can see that Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Lowa and Connecicut are clearly a cluster as people from these states would all like to go to Kauai and Kona island instead of Oahu and Maui island. 5. How does the total expenditure and visitor number of the US change by years in Hawaii? The goal of this part is to plot the expenditure and visitor number over time and find some long-term trends or patterns. We can find the US total expenditure in Hawaii mainly follows a increasing trend. Possible reasons can be the thrive of the tourism in Hawaii and inflation. There is a notable decrease in the US total expenditure from 2007 to 2009. Similar to our homework question, the financial crisis of 2008 may be able to explain this decrease. And the expenditure data of 2020 is missing for some reason, which makes us unable to check the influence of the pandemic to the US total expenditure. But at least we can see the expenditure of 2021 still followed the increase trend. Similarly, the US total visitors in Hawaii also follows a increasing trend with the same decrease from 2007 to 2009. This time we have the 2020 data. And we can find there did exist a huge decrease in the number of visitors to Hawaii on 2020. The pandemic had a great influence to the visitor number. 6. How does the total number of visitors change in seasons? After looking at the long-term trend in the previous section, we want to see some seasonality here. We will plot and compare the total number of visitors versus months. We can find that in the years without the pandemic, July is the peak of the visitor number, and March is another smaller peak. And the smallest visitor number occurs on September or January. We can find July and March represent summer holiday and spring holiday respectively. September and January represent the end of summer holiday and winter holiday respectively. It is very interesting to find the off seasons occur right after the holidays. 2020 is the special year with the pandemic. We know Covid started in the US at around March 2020. And we can find the visitor number rapidly decreased to around 0 and lasted for more than 5 months. We can find the impact of the pandemic clearly.
